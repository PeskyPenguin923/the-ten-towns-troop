Session 7

We argue over saving the speaker, it seems that we might not save him just yet.

We go into the towers, the battlements to find Hwarwar.

We walk in on a female teifling, and a man sleeping, the female says she doesn't want to wake him.

Quinn slaps the man to wake him up. "What the fuck?!"
Fel is the woman.
Hwarwar is the man.
Tells us we can go and he came here for power.

Tells us about Livistis and Avarice.
Lady Avarice is a guest in the castle.
Hwarwar hate being called a boy.
Not interested in going back, and being a slave to the town.

Lady Avarice is down in the cistern.
Hwarwar has pink nipples.

We're talking about cock fights, trying to come up with a con.

We come up to a spot with rowboats with only 2-3 seats each.
The bodies 4 of them have been murdered and they might be being stored waiting to be buried.
vera and Zin take the boat and come up to two doors, cinder flys with them.

We meet avarice in her quarters. She has no jobs, and tells us to be careful about angering the black swords.
She kicks us out of our quarters, we eventually find a lever and karnon pulls it and we hear a loud sound of the path opening in front of the boat. In that area we find 5 people chained to the wall that look malnourished and week. They are unchained and given rations, Adar wants to save them and refuses to leave them there. We decide theres no choice.
Karnon disquises the people as cultists using the robes on the dead people.

We ferry them to the exit of the tunnels and Cinder goes up the ladder and distracts the cultist at the entrance making them think the Lord is calling them. We all move up the ladder and Karnon goes to the exit gates of the compound to distract the guards. The guards are entranced by Quinn, they don't understand what it is, not that anyone really does. The others escort the prisoners out in 2 seperate groups. The first group has no issue getting out, as the second group is leaving one of the guards starts to turn but Karnon casts Thaumaturgy on the fire and it explodes pulling the gaze of the guards wandering eyes.

Once all of the prisoners are out we meet up at the abandoned inn and discuss where we go from there. We decide that it would be safer for them to leave the town, we give them gold to buy cold weather gear and advise them to head to caer-konig with a letter from us to Cori and Ally. We're sure they will give them beds for a time. We leave them and decide to head to Easthaven. 

Once we get to Easthaven we look for shops, Karnon tricks a vendor into giving us all of their magical potions. Karnon drinks a potion that gives him a third eye. The other potions seem slightly problematic. We then hear of some people that went missing at the lake so we decide to look into that.

We get out there to the rowboat we we're told about and Cinder spots to birdlike creatures flying above us. Karnon casts Eldritch Blast and a battle begins with 2 harpies. After a difficult battle we take the rowboats to some caves in the water. As we're climbing into one of the caves, the last person to climb, karnon, falls and a water creature attacks him. The others come back down to help fight. Karnon and Vera are left injured but ultimately the fight is won.
