We begin the session eating dinner in Scramsax's tavern.

Glass joins us at our table and asks us about our next move going to Caer Dineval.
We ask her why she's interested in going, and why she's interested us.
She calls us dangerous. <3
She tells us there are dangerous people and things vying for power.
There are multiple groups of people like us.
Cinder sends Glass a message asking about the albino tiefling.
Cinder receives an image in his head.
Karnon talks with Scramsax about potential jobs and checks to see if anyone was asking around for him again.
We head to bed for a long rest.
Glass gets our breakfast for us. Says shes coming with us?
We head out for Caer Dineval.

Glass is asking us our reasons and our plan for Caer Dineval.
Claims Naerth's getting glass is a business opportunity.
2 hours into our 3 hours of travel we come upon a large figure with their face covered standing over a polar bear that is downed. The 8 white bats seem to be attacking them.
Cinder cast message and asks if they need help, he hears a woman say that would be nice.

Karnon cast thaumaturgy and a loud rumble of thunder to distract the bats.
Cinder makes his familiar mimicry the sound of pleasosaurus.
The battle begins with a surprise attack from everyone.

Quinn Hp = 10/10

We win the battle, and we finally notice how tall the woman is. She pulls down her hood and we see a "pretty" rough looking woman. Zin Recognizes her, her polar bears name is Poe! She recognizes zin and runs up too him. Claims to be his work wife. Adar heals Poe! Says their name is Vertiline. Says she will owe us a favor. She's heading to Easthaven and came from the south. Unit was attacked, a lot of her unit was captured. She grills up some knucklehead trout. We take a short rest while we wait and eat. 

As we arrive to Caer Dineval the storm is starting to rage. Glass leaves us by disappearing into the night.
We attempt to find the inn. The inn Denivs Rest looks like it's out of business. We enter the back door of the inn, it was unlocked for some reason....

we walk in to see 6 duagar inside we commence battle with them hoes.

We defeat them and figure out information from one of them before murder. They are collecting chardolyn for a chardolyn dragon. Xoydar person is the one they were collecting for.

Karnon sacrifices a pair of eyes from one of the dark dwarves but all bodies are accepted.
We long slept and then went to the tarvern, The uphill Climb. rorak is the tavern owner, he offers us chowda, and gives us a warm drink in front. Roark assumes that Cinder and Karnon would be from the castle.

We go to the castle. Lord cadroth says we are esteemed guests. we enter the courtyard. We are told that Lord Cranok is inside whenever we're ready to go in. We go in to the main building. Cinder sends a message and learns that the tiefling picking up dishes is named Mere. Lord Cadroth is the lord of the black sword. Older balding red tiefling. Welcome to the Caer. Lord Cadroth says his lord is impressed with our work with the dark dwarves. His majesty livistis. Wants us to get rid of Xoydarok, claims we could have the right to the rundown inn. livistis doesn't like the Frost maiden. He goes back to work.

we meet thooooob. he doesn't like warwar. he's a dumb little bitch who cries while trying to act tough. His parent are dead.

Mere is on a bed in the servants quarters. Karnon asks if he knows where warwar is? He's probably making out with thell. Tells us thoob wets the bed. Quinn poops on thoobs bed.

We go to the kitchen, reeks of fish. Chef tells us to fuck off.

We go upstairs. Cinder goes into the room on the left. Zin goes to the room to the right. We are told that the speaker can't see anyone. We go to the library.

Cinder flies around to the window. He sees a man pooping in a chamber pot. He sends him a message. He's told to leave him alone. Tells cinder to get him out since we're not in the cult. Cinder tells us. Quinn is sitting next to the soothsayer and he is petting him. There is dwarf with a peg leg. " I've been dreading this moment." "meeting you all." tells us to sit and listen, can't be said twice, zardarok sunblight is a dwarvo warlord that will conquer icewind dale unless you defeat him, fortress on the surface hidden in the spine of the world, a forge powered by the beating heart of a red dragon. he's planning for a systematic destruction of ten towns. If we face him to soon we will lose, we must test our mettles against the horrors of icewind dale first. I take her peg leg.

There was one cultist watching the room of the speaker.
