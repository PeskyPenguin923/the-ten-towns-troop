                        We saw Cinder fall from the sky bleeding from his chest. He came across an ornate sled with a
                        man
                        lying in it missing his chest. Zin then comes across Cinder and the sled. At this point Cinder
                        blacks
                        out from his wounds, and a Zin is attacked by something in the blizzard that touches him and
                        puts him to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cut to the inn we see Karnon coming downstairs and chatting with someone named Danika Greysteel,
                        she says that she
                        thinks Chwingas have something to do with the eternal winter. Gives Karnon a magical lamp and
                        asks him to use it to find a chwinga for her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adar is led to the church to help heal some travelers that were hurt in the storm. Karnon heads
                        the same way. The church sends Vera out to talk with Karnon and see why he's here. Karnon and
                        Vera become friends :D. Adar heals Cinder before Zin wakes on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hlin Trollbane offers us 100 gold to kill Sephek A blue eyed man that's killing people who
                        bribe for their names to be out of the offering. We learn that Sephek might be in East Haven and
                        head that way. After 2 hours of travel by sled we see a caravan flying a flag with a wolfs paw
                        on it. Karnon and Cinder approach the group, Cinder sneaks and Karnon provides the distraction.
                        While Karnon is there he and Cinder over hear someone calling a guy with blue eyes Sephek.
                        Cinder attempts to sneak back to the group after Karnon leaves and is heard. Sephek attacks the
                        group
                        and the rest of the caravan leaves. Sephek is eventually felled after a long battle, he went to
                        renew his health and burned away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head back to town and see the sled with last nights offering on it, the girl is missing her
                        chest. Some
                        of the group is upset that we didn't attempt to save her. Hlin Pays us our gold and the session
                        ends.

                        We start in the tavern after receiving our payment for dispatching of Sephek. Hlin warns us
                        that there is an albino tiefling causing trouble in the North and Scramsax warns us about trying
                        to save the offerings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A woman going by the name of Glass walks into the tavern and we learn that she needs to get to
                        Targos. We offer to take her there but decide to help grab a sled of iron ingots that was
                        supposed to be delivered to Black Iron Blades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We went to the Black Iron Blades to aquire Axebeaks to be able to travel to the sled. Once we
                        have the axebeaks we start out on our several our journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are eventually forced to take refuge in a cabin that looks abandoned, when we go in we see a
                        man hanging there. It appears that he has hung himself. The cabin is covered in runes and a book
                        lies on the ground that says "The whispers in the cave, watching and waiting in the abyss.".
                        Vera takes the book and puts it in her bag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A letter is found, written from Yohon, to his mother. We take a rest to wait out the blizzard
                        and then set back out in the morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we get to the spot where the sled was supposed to be we notice tracks leading away. We
                        decided to follow the tracks and eventually come across a group of goblins pulling the sled.
                        There is a larger caravan with other people there, but we only end up fighting the goblins. We
                        fight them off and pull the sled back to Bryn Shandar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Cabin isn't there anymore when we are traveling back. Hruna pays us our gold when we return.
                        We rest and then we decide to take Glass to Targos. On the way to Targos Vera learns Glass is a
                        fiend, but does not share the information until she is gone. We drop Glass off and then a dog
                        pulls us into the town and to a house. We knock, a man named Keagan answers and asks why we have
                        his husbands dog.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keagan asks us to go up the mountain and find his husband and friend.

                        Starts with us Keagans house, Keagan is telling us about Garret and where he was going. Garrett
                        was going to Kelvins cairn and stopped by caer-konig before climbing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We go from Keagans house to the inn. We meet the Innkeep Owen, and Cinder asks about Naerth.
                        Cinder and Vera go up to Naerths room and talk with one of Naerths employees. They offer Cinder
                        work. Eventually Karnon learns from Owen that Glass works for Naerth so he and Zin go up to the
                        room to let the others know. Naerth then fills everyone in on the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He tells us of a thing called Shardolin glass. Warns us to never touch it, and tells us of
                        people that wear it for power. He wants to pay us for every piece of glass we bring him. 20g a
                        piece. He doesn't believe it has anything to do with the Frostmaiden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head to Triglio the general store in town and are told that everything is marked up 20%
                        because of who we are. We eventually travel back to Bryn Shandir on the way Kelvin Cairn. Elza
                        tells us that Torga told all the shop keeps in Ten Towns not to deal with us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We continue to Kelvins Cairn, on the way we notice a door. Karnon goes through the odd door, Zin
                        threw a snowball through it and Vera closed it before we left.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We arrive in caer-konig. The town speaker Trovis jumps out thinking we are thieves, he
                        eventually shows us to the inn, The Northern Light. Ally and Cori run the inn and tell us about
                        Garrett and his party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Garrett was traveling with a tall fellow, short girl and a tiefling. They came through a couple
                        days ago and headed up the mountain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ally also tells us about some dwarves coming down from the mountain that are stealing from the
                        town. the dwarves stole the inns lantern and we will be granted a place at the inn if we return
                        it to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cinder now has a noticable bumb on his chest. We rest for the night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We visit the Hook Line and Sinker in the morning, we are greeted with ale and food. The owner,
                        Glen, tells us Jarthra is a person that works at the Frozen Far that we can higher to guide us
                        up the mountain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head to the Frozen Far and Atennis, the owner, tells us Jarthra will char 2-5g per day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We eventually meet Jarthra and they agree to take us up the mountain for 5g a day. We begin to
                        look for their base camp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While on our way to the base camp Zin and Karnon notice tracks in the snow. These tracks turn
                        into sled tracks that look to be pulled by an ogre possibly. We decide to remember this for
                        later and continue to the basecamp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we reach the base camp we find it destroyed, the sled is overturned with 5 dogs still
                        attached to it. We release the dogs and they head back to town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While following tracks up the mountain that resemble Garrett's party we are hit by an avalanche.
                        Once we escape from the snow we find the bloody body of Garrett.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Garrett is in rough shape, he has a broken leg and only 6 health. Jarthra offers to take Garrett
                        back down the mountain. We continue up the mountain to look for the rest of the party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We eventually reach a cave mouth and while deciding what to do, we are attacked by two crag
                        cats. We defeat them quickly and move in the cave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inside the cave we see an ice path to the left and a sturdy bridge to the right. We go to the
                        left and at a ledge above us we see a yeti and it's child. The Child is playing with a halfling
                        girl.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We attempt to distract them and the baby hides behind it's mom. We then offer the crag cat
                        bodies to the yeti's as a trade. We pull the halfing towards the exit when the yeti's move away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we are leaving the cave a large yeti that appears to be the father is entering. He does not
                        give us a chance to leave and the fight ensues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The party finally defeats the yeti after Karnon goes down. We then continue up the mountain to
                        find the tiefling. We eventually find them and they begin to claim that they don't feel the cold
                        anymore. They come down the mountain with us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we reach the bottom of the mountain Asterix and the tiefling tell us they will be returning
                        to Easthaven. Parloo asks what the tiefling is holding. We see a piece of black glass in their
                        hand and attempt to get them to hand it over. They do not.

                        We finally arrive back at the tavern to see all the dogs and Garrett there. Before we go to bed
                        for the night, Vera uses Lay on Hands on Cinder and an egg pushes its way out of his chest hits
                        the ground and dissolves leaving a dead lizard on the ground.
