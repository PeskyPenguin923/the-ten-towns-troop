                        We saw Cinder fall from the sky bleeding from his chest. He came across an ornate sled with a
                        man
                        lying in it missing his chest. Zin then comes across Cinder and the sled. At this point Cinder
                        blacks
                        out from his wounds, and a Zin is attacked by something in the blizzard that touches him and
                        puts him to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cut to the inn we see Karnon coming downstairs and chatting with someone named Danika Greysteel,
                        she says that she
                        thinks Chwingas have something to do with the eternal winter. Gives Karnon a magical lamp and
                        asks him to use it to find a chwinga for her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adar is led to the church to help heal some travelers that were hurt in the storm. Karnon heads
                        the same way. The church sends Vera out to talk with Karnon and see why he's here. Karnon and
                        Vera become friends :D. Adar heals Cinder before Zin wakes on their own.
                    </p>

                        Hilin Trollbane offers us 100 gold to kill Sephek A blue eyed man that's killing people who
                        bribe for their names to be out of the offering. We learn that Sephek might be in East Haven and
                        head that way. After 2 hours of travel by sled we see a caravan flying a flag with a wolfs paw
                        on it. Karnon and Cinder approach the group, Cinder sneaks and Karnon provides the distraction.
                        While Karnon is there he and Cinder over hear someone calling a guy with blue eyes Sephek.
                        Cinder attempts to sneak back to the group after Karnon leaves and is heard. Sephek attacks the
                        group
                        and the rest of the caravan leaves. Sephek is eventually felled after a long battle, he went to
                        renew his
                        health and burned away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head back to town and see the sled with last nights offering on it, the girl is missing her
                        chest. Some
                        of the group is upset that we didn't attempt to save her. Hilin Pays us our gold and the session
                        ends.
