                        We saw Cinder fall from the sky bleeding from his chest. He came across an ornate sled with a
                        man
                        lying in it missing his chest. Zin then comes across Cinder and the sled. At this point Cinder
                        blacks
                        out from his wounds, and a Zin is attacked by something in the blizzard that touches him and
                        puts him to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cut to the inn we see Karnon coming downstairs and chatting with someone named Danika Greysteel,
                        she says that she
                        thinks Chwingas have something to do with the eternal winter. Gives Karnon a magical lamp and
                        asks him to use it to find a chwinga for her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adar is led to the church to help heal some travelers that were hurt in the storm. Karnon heads
                        the same way. The church sends Vera out to talk with Karnon and see why he's here. Karnon and
                        Vera become friends :D. Adar heals Cinder before Zin wakes on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hlin Trollbane offers us 100 gold to kill Sephek A blue eyed man that's killing people who
                        bribe for their names to be out of the offering. We learn that Sephek might be in East Haven and
                        head that way. After 2 hours of travel by sled we see a caravan flying a flag with a wolfs paw
                        on it. Karnon and Cinder approach the group, Cinder sneaks and Karnon provides the distraction.
                        While Karnon is there he and Cinder over hear someone calling a guy with blue eyes Sephek.
                        Cinder attempts to sneak back to the group after Karnon leaves and is heard. Sephek attacks the
                        group
                        and the rest of the caravan leaves. Sephek is eventually felled after a long battle, he went to
                        renew his health and burned away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head back to town and see the sled with last nights offering on it, the girl is missing her
                        chest. Some
                        of the group is upset that we didn't attempt to save her. Hlin Pays us our gold and the session
                        ends.

                        We start in the tavern after receiving our payment for dispatching of Sephek. Hlin warns us
                        that there is an albino tiefling causing trouble in the North and Scramsax warns us about trying
                        to save the offerings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A woman going by the name of Glass walks into the tavern and we learn that she needs to get to
                        Targos. We offer to take her there but decide to help grab a sled of iron ingots that was
                        supposed to be delivered to Black Iron Blades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We went to the Black Iron Blades to aquire Axebeaks to be able to travel to the sled. Once we
                        have the axebeaks we start out on our several our journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are eventually forced to take refuge in a cabin that looks abandoned, when we go in we see a
                        man hanging there. It appears that he has hung himself. The cabin is covered in runes and a book
                        lies on the ground that says "The whispers in the cave, watching and waiting in the abyss.".
                        Vera takes the book and puts it in her bag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A letter is found, written from Yohon, to his mother. We take a rest to wait out the blizzard
                        and then set back out in the morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we get to the spot where the sled was supposed to be we notice tracks leading away. We
                        decided to follow the tracks and eventually come across a group of goblins pulling the sled.
                        There is a larger caravan with other people there, but we only end up fighting the goblins. We
                        fight them off and pull the sled back to Bryn Shandar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Cabin isn't there anymore when we are traveling back. Hruna pays us our gold when we return.
                        We rest and then we decide to take Glass to Targos. On the way to Targos Vera learns Glass is a
                        fiend, but does not share the information until she is gone. We drop Glass off and then a dog
                        pulls us into the town and to a house. We knock, a man named Keagan answers and asks why we have
                        his husbands dog.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keagan asks us to go up the mountain and find his husband and friend.

                        Starts with us Keagans house, Keagan is telling us about Garret and where he was going. Garrett
                        was going to Kelvins cairn and stopped by caer-konig before climbing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We go from Keagans house to the inn. We meet the Innkeep Owen, and Cinder asks about Naerth.
                        Cinder and Vera go up to Naerths room and talk with one of Naerths employees. They offer Cinder
                        work. Eventually Karnon learns from Owen that Glass works for Naerth so he and Zin go up to the
                        room to let the others know. Naerth then fills everyone in on the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He tells us of a thing called Shardolin glass. Warns us to never touch it, and tells us of
                        people that wear it for power. He wants to pay us for every piece of glass we bring him. 20g a
                        piece. He doesn't believe it has anything to do with the Frostmaiden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head to Triglio the general store in town and are told that everything is marked up 20%
                        because of who we are. We eventually travel back to Bryn Shandir on the way Kelvin Cairn. Elza
                        tells us that Torga told all the shop keeps in Ten Towns not to deal with us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We continue to Kelvins Cairn, on the way we notice a door. Karnon goes through the odd door, Zin
                        threw a snowball through it and Vera closed it before we left.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We arrive in caer-konig. The town speaker Trovis jumps out thinking we are thieves, he
                        eventually shows us to the inn, The Northern Light. Ally and Cori run the inn and tell us about
                        Garrett and his party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Garrett was traveling with a tall fellow, short girl and a tiefling. They came through a couple
                        days ago and headed up the mountain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ally also tells us about some dwarves coming down from the mountain that are stealing from the
                        town. the dwarves stole the inns lantern and we will be granted a place at the inn if we return
                        it to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cinder now has a noticable bumb on his chest. We rest for the night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We visit the Hook Line and Sinker in the morning, we are greeted with ale and food. The owner,
                        Glen, tells us Jarthra is a person that works at the Frozen Far that we can higher to guide us
                        up the mountain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head to the Frozen Far and Atennis, the owner, tells us Jarthra will char 2-5g per day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We eventually meet Jarthra and they agree to take us up the mountain for 5g a day. We begin to
                        look for their base camp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While on our way to the base camp Zin and Karnon notice tracks in the snow. These tracks turn
                        into sled tracks that look to be pulled by an ogre possibly. We decide to remember this for
                        later and continue to the basecamp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we reach the base camp we find it destroyed, the sled is overturned with 5 dogs still
                        attached to it. We release the dogs and they head back to town.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While following tracks up the mountain that resemble Garrett's party we are hit by an avalanche.
                        Once we escape from the snow we find the bloody body of Garrett.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Garrett is in rough shape, he has a broken leg and only 6 health. Jarthra offers to take Garrett
                        back down the mountain. We continue up the mountain to look for the rest of the party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We eventually reach a cave mouth and while deciding what to do, we are attacked by two crag
                        cats. We defeat them quickly and move in the cave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inside the cave we see an ice path to the left and a sturdy bridge to the right. We go to the
                        left and at a ledge above us we see a yeti and it's child. The Child is playing with a halfling
                        girl.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We attempt to distract them and the baby hides behind it's mom. We then offer the crag cat
                        bodies to the yeti's as a trade. We pull the halfing towards the exit when the yeti's move away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we are leaving the cave a large yeti that appears to be the father is entering. He does not
                        give us a chance to leave and the fight ensues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The party finally defeats the yeti after Karnon goes down. We then continue up the mountain to
                        find the tiefling. We eventually find them and they begin to claim that they don't feel the cold
                        anymore. They come down the mountain with us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we reach the bottom of the mountain Asterix and the tiefling tell us they will be returning
                        to Easthaven. Parloo asks what the tiefling is holding. We see a piece of black glass in their
                        hand and attempt to get them to hand it over. They do not.

                    <p>
                        We finally arrive back at the tavern to see all the dogs and Garrett there. Before we go to bed
                        for the night, Vera uses Lay on Hands on Cinder and an egg pushes its way out of his chest hits
                        the ground and dissolves leaving a dead lizard on the ground.

                    <p>
                        We start by eating breakfast before heading back up the mountain. While eating breakfast Ally
                        tells us about a white moose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head out to the place where we saw the tracks in the snow and begin to follow them. They lead
                        us to a snowy fortress on the hillside. Karnon notices that there is someone on the roof of part
                        of the building, so the party decides to hug the wall on the right side and sneak up to the
                        front doors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is decided that going through the front door would not be smart. We climb into a hole and end
                        up inside of a well in the main room of the fortress. Cinder flys up and scouts the layout and
                        see's 3 cages, one with an ogre and one with 2 goats inside of it.
                        We all climb up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we all reach the floor the ogre see us and begins to yell. Everyone goes to hide, but before
                        Karnon has a chance to move a Dueger woman comes out and yell's at the ogre. She spots Karnon in
                        the open and blows a horn warning the others in the fortress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A large Dueger man opens the cage that the ogre is in and yells at the female dwarf for failing
                        to protect him before he leaves. We fight multiple dwarves in the room before the last one
                        finally runs away. We go to follow him into the other room. As Vera and Adar pass through a
                        hallway someone shouts "In the name of Xardorokay Sunblight stop!" A gate comes crashing down
                        behind the two of them separating the party, before the next fight begins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We eventually murder all of the combatants and Adar pulls the lever to open the gate for the
                        rest of the party to come through. Several of the enemies were holding amulets of shardolyn
                        glass. We carefully wrap and gather the amulets for later. There ended up being enough amulets
                        for each of us to have one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We enter a room that contains a desk and other things. We begin to look through the room for
                        things that could help us or that look valuable. Cinder finds gold and shares with the party.
                        While Karnon begins to say something about the people in the fortress he is hit in the back of
                        the head by 2 daggers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We notice they came from an invisable guy from the corner, we begin to fight with him and learn
                        that he is Nildar Sunblight. He also tells us that the glass is the key to everything and the
                        end of Ten Towns. His father is the king of the mountain, Xardorokay Sunblight. Before the end
                        of the battle Nildar says " My father is more powerful than any of you filthy creatures could
                        imagine. You don't understand the glory of it, the power found in the ice. None of you do, but
                        you will learn soon enough when father unleashes his terror upon Ten-towns! Your doom soars on
                        dragon's wings!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we are going to leave we see cells filled with creatures that are barely alive that have been
                        clearly experimented on. We decide it would be best to put them out of their misery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then head back to Caer-konig, Ally thanks us for returning the stolen items. She also tells
                        us that we will always have a place to stay when we visit Caer-konig. She also tells us about a
                        monster in lake Maer Dualdon in Bremen. We take her up on the
                        offer of a place to stay and get some much needed rest and sleep for the night.

                    <p>
                        We awake in the morning and meet in the lobby of the Northern Lights Inn. Cinder comes down
                        stairs with a familiar of a raven named Eira. Karnon also appears to have a new familiar with
                        him as he comes down. It looks like a purple penguin, but it's form seems off, almost like it
                        doesn't know how it's supposed to look. It's name is Quinn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decide to travel to Targos and get on our way. Cinder appearantley learned some new spells
                        the night before and uses them to toss snowballs at the party from out of nowhere. We stop in
                        Brynshander on the way to Targos and visit our dear friend Scramsax. Scramsax tells Karnon that
                        two women were asking about him. One of the women had red curly hair and the other was wearing
                        black and covered up. He also tells Vera that there is a letter at the church for her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head to the church to collect the letter and Vera talks with Mishann. We then visit the Black
                        Iron Blades to sell and buy goods from Elza before getting back on the road to Targos. We arrive
                        in Targos by 8pm. The first thing we do is stop in to see Keagan and Garrett. They're happy to
                        see us and offer us a care package and some hand carved figures. We then spend the night there.
                        In the night each person in the party has a different dream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decide to head to Nearth's office to provide him with some of the amulets we collected.
                        Cinder
                        and Vera give him their amulets for the gold. He pays us to deliver a letter to speaker
                        Briggman. We leave for Bremman and arrive there by 10AM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We meet a person name Grynsk who thinks we're his new fishing crew and he gives us to boats to
                        go out on and catch fish. A person named Tally wants us to take notes of the monster if we end
                        up seeing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adar drops the herbs they've had off at the church and writes a letter to them letting them know
                        we will return. We then go back to the dock set off in the boats. As we are fishing we spot a
                        disturbance in the water. At that time a plesiosaurus comes out of the water and damages one of
                        the boats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Karnon cast command on the plesiosaurus and tell it that it can't harm anyone or attack for 8
                        hours. The creature responds in common, "I'm listening.". We learn that someone named ravison
                        gave the plesiosaurus knowledge and that they must continue to guard the lake to maintain this
                        knowledge. We eventually leave the creature after recording what we learned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We ended up catching 17 fish, Grynsk gives us 75 copper for the catch. Tally was very grateful
                        of the information we obtained, he gave us some gold and an animal friendship scroll. We decided
                        to go to the tavern. Karnon notices that the lady working, cora, in the tavern is having a hard
                        time, he decides to help her while the others take a seat. The letter is delivered to speaker
                        Briggman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cora gives us food and something to drink after the rush and talks with us. She tells us that
                        she has a son named Huarwar and he got frost bitten and had shard of black glass in his
                        possesion. Cora believes
                        that someone took Huawar to the old
                        castle in Caer-dineval. We thank Cora for the information and the food and return to the church
                        for Adar's reward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While outside, Karnon lights his magical lantern and it glows showing that there are chwingas
                        around. He follows the lamp to a house and enters it. He sees small footprints leading into the
                        woods and come across several chwingas playing around a plate with silverware. It looks like
                        they're acting like they have food to cut up and eat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Karnon attempts to catch one but fails. He then decides to cast a minor illusion of a burger
                        onto the plate. The chwingas love it, they have us play with them for awhile. Eventually Karnon
                        is able to pick one up and put it into a makeshift papussa. We then decide to travel back to
                        Brynshander to deliver it to Danika. She pays us for our delivery and the session ends there.

                        We begin by eating dinner at Scramsax's Tavern. Glass sits at the table and talks to us about
                        our next move. She tells us she's interested in us and likes our group. Karnon asks Scramsax
                        about potential jobs and he tells him that he might have something for them in a day. We set out
                        for Caer-dineval.

                    <p>
                        While on our way, we come across a large figure standing over a polar bear surrounded by 8
                        flying figures. They appear to be a white bat or something. Before engaging Cinder and Karnon
                        use there skills to make a distraction and we catch them by surprise. After a dangerous fight we
                        finally prevail.

                        she will owe us a favor. Her unit was attacked and mostly captured.
