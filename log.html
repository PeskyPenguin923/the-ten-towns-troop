                        We saw Cinder fall from the sky bleeding from his chest. He came across an ornate sled with a
                        man
                        lying in it missing his chest. Zin then comes across Cinder and the sled. At this point Cinder
                        blacks
                        out from his wounds, and a Zin is attacked by something in the blizzard that touches him and
                        puts him to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cut to the inn we see Karnon coming downstairs and chatting with someone named Danika Greysteel,
                        she says that she
                        thinks Chwingas have something to do with the eternal winter. Gives Karnon a magical lamp and
                        asks him to use it to find a chwinga for her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adar is led to the church to help heal some travelers that were hurt in the storm. Karnon heads
                        the same way. The church sends Vera out to talk with Karnon and see why he's here. Karnon and
                        Vera become friends :D. Adar heals Cinder before Zin wakes on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hlin Trollbane offers us 100 gold to kill Sephek A blue eyed man that's killing people who
                        bribe for their names to be out of the offering. We learn that Sephek might be in East Haven and
                        head that way. After 2 hours of travel by sled we see a caravan flying a flag with a wolfs paw
                        on it. Karnon and Cinder approach the group, Cinder sneaks and Karnon provides the distraction.
                        While Karnon is there he and Cinder over hear someone calling a guy with blue eyes Sephek.
                        Cinder attempts to sneak back to the group after Karnon leaves and is heard. Sephek attacks the
                        group
                        and the rest of the caravan leaves. Sephek is eventually felled after a long battle, he went to
                        renew his health and burned away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We head back to town and see the sled with last nights offering on it, the girl is missing her
                        chest. Some
                        of the group is upset that we didn't attempt to save her. Hlin Pays us our gold and the session
                        ends.

                        We start in the tavern after receiving our payment for dispatching of Sephek. Hlin warns us
                        that there is an albino tiefling causing trouble in the North and Scramsax warns us about trying
                        to save the offerings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A woman going by the name of Glass walks into the tavern and we learn that she needs to get to
                        Targos. We offer to take her there but decide to help grab a sled of iron ingots that was
                        supposed to be delivered to Black Iron Blades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We went to the Black Iron Blades to aquire Axebeaks to be able to travel to the sled. Once we
                        have the axebeaks we start out on our several our journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are eventually forced to take refuge in a cabin that looks abandoned, when we go in we see a
                        man hanging there. It appears that he has hung himself. The cabin is covered in runes and a book
                        lies on the ground that says "The whispers in the cave, watching and waiting in the abyss.".
                        Vera takes the book and puts it in her bag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A letter is found, written from Yohon, to his mother. We take a rest to wait out the blizzard
                        and then set back out in the morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As we get to the spot where the sled was supposed to be we notice tracks leading away. We
                        decided to follow the tracks and eventually come across a group of goblins pulling the sled.
                        There is a larger caravan with other people there, but we only end up fighting the goblins. We
                        fight them off and pull the sled back to Bryn Shandar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Cabin isn't there anymore when we are traveling back. Hruna pays us our gold when we return.
                        We rest and then we decide to take Glass to Targos. On the way to Targos Vera learns Glass is a
                        fiend, but does not share the information until she is gone. We drop Glass off and then a dog
                        pulls us into the town and to a house. We knock, a man named Keagan answers and asks why we have
                        his husbands dog.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keagan asks us to go up the mountain and find his husband and friend.
